## Goals

The goal is to define an entire life cycle of communication between a Front-End Machine to a DMZ Network Back-End machine passing thru API Gee Proxy and Network Gateway that redirect call to the Service.

Here a simple communication diagram :

Here an APIGee enterprise communication diagram :

The players in the architecture are :
* Client System : It can be any application that have to request API Rest Services
* Client Gateway : NGNIX Proxy communicating with your APIGee Proxies
* APIGee Micro-Gateway : Reverse Proxy and API Manager, APIGee Edge Organization Account
* Service Gateway : Buildit Gateway API Rest streaming manager, down-streaming APIGee Proxy requests
* REST API Service: Machine with a sampler pipeline (Jenkins, SonarQube, Sonar PostgreSQL database and Nexus OSS docker containers)

This project realizes a RIG instance on following cloud providers:
* Amazon Web Service

## Technology

Ansible python scripts.


## Issues during the Experience definition

APIGee Gateway limitation for free organization on java-callout feature interrupted the experience, no Edge-Microgateway feature could be tested on a free account.
